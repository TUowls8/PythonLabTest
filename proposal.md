# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Autonomus Waypoint Robot Simulator

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Python code accepts an array of waypoints inputted manually by a user. it will also accept a heading for the robot from teh user. Either for a yeard or worksite, and the code will simulate turns, heading, distance and postion of the robot over time. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The softare will have a GUI that allows the user to input a set amount of waypoints in LONG and LATT cords. Once the user is done mapping those cords in google earth, the software will accept the inputs and run them through the haversine formula, which shows distance between waypoints in meters using lon and latt. It will also include an inital heading inputed by the user which will be used to simulate where the robot will be facing throughout the looping of waypoints. So, the software will determine distance between waypoints, total distance travels, turn radius of the robot, bearing of the waypoints and finally the robots heading after each run. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Full completion and a working product. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Will have an updated GUI and a way to automatically upload waypoints values to python software instead of manually doing it. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to have all hte maths working and a basic user interface. Best outcome would be a very clea GUI and an automatic excel file upload of waypoints created byt the user in google maps. 

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
